# Collab3PL V18 - Inventory Management

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Provide a minimal, clean inventory tracking system for 3PL operations with essential CRUD functionality.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can list, search, create, and delete inventory items with proper validation and persistence.
- **Experience Qualities**: Simple, efficient, reliable.

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Creating and managing inventory data

## Essential Features
- **Inventory List View**: Searchable list with filtering by SKU, name, UPC, and location
- **Inventory Creation**: Form-based creation with validation for required fields
- **Local Persistence**: Data stored in localStorage with proper schema validation
- **Integration**: Follows existing app patterns for routing, forms, and storage
